# Project: Stroke Prediction using Logistic Regression

This is a R group project for the UBC course Advanced Predictive Business Analytics. I coworked with Rhea Gupta and Kook Han for this project during January ~ February 2022.

### Introduction:
Our project purpose is first to examine the relationship between stroke and other predictors, and then build a valid logistic regression model to predict the probability of stroke with the selected predictor variable(s).

### Analysis Steps Breakdown:
Currently, the Rmd file contains below steps. We'll finalize our findings in Feb 2022, and I will upload our results here.
Step 1. Report Summary Statistics after Data Cleansing
Step 2. Assess Model Assumptions including Linearity, Additivity, and Multicollinearity
Step 3. Variable Selections using Stepwise Backward Selection
Step 4. Modelling with and without influential observations

### Results:
